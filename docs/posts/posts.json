    "contents": "\n\n\n\n\nAfter we’ve calculated our buffer counts and fit our fancy mixed effects regression model what kind of claims can we make about the results?\n\nIn the paper we’ve been studying, the author’s estimate a negative difference in the number of crimes around vacant lots randomly assigned the greening or mowing interventions. There are a number of claims that the author’s can now make, each requiring an increasing number of assumptions in order to be valid. In this post, we’ll walk through these claims step-by-step, identifying the tools the author’s did or did not use to try to fulfill the assumption.\nDescriptive Statistics vs. Causal Inference\nLet’s start with the easiest, most defensible claim the authors can make after finishing their analysis. I’ll limit these statements to just the greening intervention since that had the most robust results across models.\n“The greening intervention was associated with a decrease in crimes in the area proximal to the vacant lots in our sample.”\nThere are two key words that I’ve bolded in the above quote. The first — associated — is important because it implies that there is not necessarily a causal relationship between the greening intervention nearby crime. The second — sample — implies that the association may be limited to the sample and not generalizable to a larger population of vacant lots and shooting crimes generically found in the world at large.\nThese claims fall under the category of what statisticians might colloquially call “descriptive,” in that they are absolutely true in describing the sample as observed. Scientific research generally aims to establish more general truths that describe the causal relationships that determine the data we observe. In order to make the jump from describing our sample to describing the world, there are several assumptions we have to make, critical to our ability to draw a causal conclusion from our descriptive analysis.\nAssumptions Assumptions\nHere’s a slightly stronger claim than the previous.\n“The decrease in crime observed was caused by the greening intervention in our sample.”\nIn order to make the jump in claim from association, or correlation, to causation the author’s need to defend their ability to have met the identifiability assumptions for a causal effect. I’ve discussed these ideas in greater depth here and here but for now we’ll focus on (1) the author’s used their second buffer model to check for spillover effects and how this relates to the notion of of interference, as well as (2) how the author’s use of randomization should provide them with some justification for arguing that the intervention assignment is independent of other potential confounding factors.\nSpillover and Interference\nIf a cluster of vacant lots were assigned to the greening intervention, how far would the decrease in crime associated with that intervention extend out in space? Is it possible that the effect could impinge upon another vacant lot?\n\nHere we’re considering the spatial scale of the intervention. Just as, potentially important is the temporal scale, or that time at which the intervention has it’s greatest impact. See (Peterson, Hirsch, and Sanchez 2021) for more on this idea.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of buffer zones around hypothetical vacant lot. First buffer in green is used to detect proximal increase/decrease in crime, while the second is used to check for spillover effects by considering the non-overlapping area between the two circles.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the method the author’s used to check for “spill-over.” By looking both 300 and 600 meters around the vacant lots they sought to establish that the interventions did not simply move the shootings from closely to slightly further away, but actually did diminish the overall number of shootings. However! What the author’s failed to acknowledge and comment on in their paper, was the impact that this extended spatial impact — when one vacant lot’s effect may impinge upon another — may have upon their estimates of the intervention effect, as it demonstrates the capacity for these vacant lot interventions to interfere with one another. Recall that the author’s clustered vacant lots in order to try and limit the impact from spatial proximity, but this extended spatial effect shows the effect may go farther than previously anticipated. We’ll use this as a point of discussion in a future blog-post but for now we’ll simply consider it a question this result leaves us asking.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Visualization of different vacant lots proximal to one another whose effects may interfere with one another despite clustering.\n\n\n\nRepeat Randomization\nAnother tool the author’s used was randomization: “A repeat randomization procedure ensured that the clusters were balanced on potential confounding variables including the total area and mean separating distance of the vacant lots, the resident population, and the number of Summary Reporting System Part I serious violent and property crimes, such as robbery and burglary.” (Moyer et al. 2019).\nThe authors use randomization to try and create exchangeability between the different intervention groups. That is that there is just as much likelihood of a crime occurring in the area proximal to a control vacant lot as it would in an area proximal to a vacant lot receiving one of the two interventions.\nThere are two things to note here, (i) the author’s are doing everything they can to try and ensure that these different vacant lot clusters are comparable across the different intervention groups and (ii), they seem to have trouble accomplishing this goal.\nAs they state in their results, “The greened lots tended to have a slightly higher average shooting rate in the baseline period (pre), which we accounted for in the regression estimates.” This imbalance1 between the different intervention groups, reflects a difficult truth in built environment research and the larger realm encompassing the social sciences more generally: it is really hard to make things that are fundamentally different comparable for the sake of analysis. This may be why the authors chose to conduct their analysis using the difference-in-difference estimators, as this is not the strongest, or “best” contrast that a scientist typically hopes to make in establishing a causal effect.\nTreatment Effects\nLet’s continue with our hierarchy of claims.\n“Applying greening interventions caused there to be a reduction in crime around vacant lots greater than one would observe otherwise.”\nThis is a very specific kind of claim that may be more familiar when considered in the context of a pharmaceutical clinical trial. If we were to randomly assign a treatment and placebo to a group of individuals who had some disease, we would be most interested in the difference of outcomes between the individuals who had the treatment and those who had the control. In statistics and causal inference this is called the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), and is the most frequent causal estimand of interest. If \\(A_i=1\\) indicates the \\(i\\)th subject received the treatment and \\(A_i=0\\) indicates the \\(i\\)th subject received the placebo and we were measuring some outcome \\(Y^{(t)}_i\\) at time points \\(t=0,1\\), then we would estimate the ATE as follows: \\[\n\\hat{ATE} = E[Y^{1}|A=1] - E[Y^1|A=0].\n\\] Another causal estimand is the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated or ATET. This estimand is represented by the following expression, note the difference in the time points and treatment variables : \\[\n\\hat{ATET} = E[Y^{1}|A=1] - E[Y^{0}|A=1].\n\\] Graphically, this idea can be represented as the difference between the two points connected by the line in Figure 3 below.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Visualization of Average Treatment Effect (ATE) and Average Treatment Effect on the Treated(ATET) below using the crime density estimates from (Moyer et al. 2019). Solid line is above the two points involved in the ATET and the dotted line is above the two points involved in calculating the ATE.\n\n\n\nBringing these ideas back to the claim at hand, the author’s did not provide or aim to justify this statement. By using a difference-in-difference estimator they estimated the ATET, which was their “take-home” result mentioned in their abstract. While this is still an interesting result, it does make a reader like me wonder why they went to the effort of randomizing interventions as they did, if they didn’t even use their control vacant lots in the contrast estimate of the intervention effect(s). My guess is that the result was not significantly different, or worse, the control group had significantly less crime than the intervention and they didn’t want this result complicating their story.\nThe authors do have some justification for focusing on the ATET as they did. As mentioned above, the pre-intervention crime measures for the three different vacant lot groups were all different, suggesting these may not have been as comparable as they should have been from randomization. Given that, it seems that one of the best and most conservative things the authors could do, would be to focus on the ATET as they did. Still, it is not the best one might hope for when looking to advance the cause of “place-based interventions” as I and the authors both hope to do.\n\n\n\nGeneralizability\n“Greening vacant lots will reduce in crime in the surrounding area generally not just in Philadelphia”\nSeparate from the ideas of ATE’s, ATET’s and randomization is the question of generalizability. How much can we hope that the results found here will be reproduced in other cities around the globe? This likely depends on the mechanism by which violent crimes manifest, as well as how greening or mowing vacant lots plays into this mechanism. The authors speak to this idea in part in their discussion, and we’ll discuss this idea further in the subsequent post discussing the substantive reasoning at play in this study. For now it might suffice to say that the more similar a city is to Philadelphia the more likely one would be to feel justified in expecting these results to apply and vice versus.\nRecap and Conclusion\nLet’s review the different claims made and how they each measured up in our analysis.\n“The greening intervention was associated with a decrease in crimes in the area proximal to the vacant lots in our sample.”\nThis claim has the strongest level of evidence for it. In fact I’d say it is trivially true, barring any serious data collection or study design errors.\n“The decrease in crime observed was caused by the greening intervention in our sample.”\nThis claim is more difficult to defend. The author’s focus on the ATET estimate certainly provides the most justification for this claim. However, there is still the potential for interference — despite clustering – to attenuate this estimate or reformulate how the effect manifests.\n“Applying greening interventions caused there to be a reduction in crime around vacant lots greater than one would observe otherwise.”\nThe author’s can’t defend this claim. While they tried to make their intervention and control groups as comparable as possible through randomization, baseline crime measures between the groups were quite different, forcing the author’s to abandon any contrast estimate between groups and focus only on within group differences.\n“Greening vacant lots will reduce in crime in the surrounding area generally not just in Philadelphia”\nYes and no, cities are highly variable and not at all homogeneous. The more similar a city is to Philadelphia, the more likely the results may apply. However, this is true for every built environment or place-based intervention, and shouldn’t be held against the author’s good-faith effort here.\nOverall, this study is still quite strong, with only aspects of interference related to point 2. and lack of comparability related to point 3. holding them back from making all the claims that one could hope for from this work.\n\n\n\nGelman, Andrew, Jennifer Hill, and Aki Vehtari. 2020.

    "contents": "\nIf we change the zoning on a region of land from being used exclusively for single family houses to mixed-use apartments and retail, will this increase the number of cars on the nearby road? If an individual moves to an apartment where they have a greater number of grocery store options to choose from, will they weigh less in 2 months than if they stayed at their current location? These are the kinds of causal questions asked by those interested in understanding the built environment. I’ve written on this subject more broadly elsewhere, but want to return to it now in a setting where the complexities of working with built environment data can be more explicitly highlighted. Note that if you’re not familiar with causal inference concepts already you may need to read the previous post series linked and/or check out one of the numerous references I suggest here.\n1. Lack of Randomization\nThere are a number of obstacles that built environment data typically involve when an investigator sets out to study causal relationship. The first is that, typically, it is impossible to randomize the exposure — e.g. grocery stores — of interest. Whereas vaccines, drugs, and even some government programs can be randomly assigned to individuals, it isn’t possible to randomly assign a park to a neighborhood or a certain kind of business to a specific storefront. These kinds of decisions are extremely expensive and will often involve a substantial amount of political decision making, rendering any attempt to introduce randomness a doomed prospect from the start. As the reader may be aware, randomization is key to ensuring that the units of analysis - individuals, streets, etc. - are comparable. That is, there is no reason to think a priori that those who have been treated or exposed are any different from those in the control.\n\nIf you want to see one interesting case where an environmental exposure is randomized. See here, to be discussed here soon!\nThis is obviously not the case in the built environment. We observe differences in the underlying populations associated with certain built environment exposures constantly. Dense, walk-able neighborhoods, tend to be much more expensive than their suburban counterparts. Wealth is correlated with education, and so one might expect a wide range of different health outcomes between those in dense walk-able neighborhoods for example and their more rural counterparts that are not due to the built environment at all, but rather the wealth and/or education with which they are correlated. Adjusting for these factors in order to create as comparable a comparison as possible is crucial, if one is to trust the resulting causal estimate.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Distribution of Median Income Across Allegheny County, PA Census Tracts.\n\n\n\n2. Interference\nEven if one were able to randomize some treatment to a built environment feature1 (BEF), one then has to consider the effects of interference. Interference is the name given to the phenomenon when an intervention or treatment on one entity affects the outcome of another. A violation of the commonly held Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption or SUTVA, interference rears its heads often in the built environment when the treatment or intervention - the new upzoned region - affects not only the number of cars on the street immediately in front of it but also proximate streets, all under observation. Decomposing these effects across related units typically requires assumptions and/or prior understanding of the system under study. As such, interference can represent a major obstacle to making progress in this space.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Observed 15 minute traffic rate on selected street blocks in Rittenhouse, Philadelphia from 2015-2020. Traffic rate is proportional to point size.\n\n\n\n3. Homogeneity, Additivity and More\nStill more problems await! In trying to understand how certain built environment features may affect human health or other aspects of the built environment, we’ll likely have to make even further assumptions. In our example with grocery stores, we’ll likely need to make some assumption that say, Kroger and Meier are equivalent grocery stores. This could be more justified than saying that the local farmer’s market could also merit the label of a “grocery store”. Assuming homogeneity in this manner greatly simplifies our modeling, but also runs us into conflicting with an assumption of consistency at the heart of causal inference.\nAdditivity is another such assumption that simplifies the mathematical tools required to estimate the causal estimand2 of interest. However, just as with assuming homogeneity, the simplicity that additivity enables in our mathematical modeling may not be justified by our principled understanding of the causal system under study.\nEven now, after listing all these challenges I don’t want to leave you with the impression that we’ve covered all the obstacles. Others may still rear their head!\n\nAssuming additivity can turn the model \\(Y = f(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{k})\\) into \\(Y = \\sum_k f(x_{k})\\) which is considerably easier to estimate.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Differences in hypothetical exposures for additive vs. non-additive models.\n\n\n\nSolutions\nAt this point, it may seem as though there is no way we can ever hope to understand the built environment amidst all the many non-randomized, correlated and interfering forces at work. Fear not, there are still some things we can do. Though we’ll likely never have the same level of confidence in our results as we would in a randomized control trial, we can try to incorporate more information through regression, narrow our focus with difference in difference estimators, model the interference associated with interventions, and allow for heterogeneous treatment effects in our model estimates. All this and more will be discussed as a part of blog posts to come but if you’re interested in learning more of the theory behind these ideas, I’d suggest you check out the statistics references linked to on this site’s reference page.

    "contents": "\nOf all the things to talk about, why talk about the places where we live? Whether a city, town, suburb, or remote rural residence, the environments we live in define our lives. They constrain – or enable – the things we do, the people we see, the food we eat … you get the picture. But still – who cares? And why write about them right now?\nIn this post I’m going to try and convince you that, barring any commitments you may have made to a myopic nihilism, you care about the built environment, and urban spaces1 more generally, for at least 3 broad reasons, that will motivate much of the writing to follow. Here I’ll appeal to intuition, cite news articles, and be generally “un-academic” or imprecise, but this will likely change in subsequent posts. For now I hope to convince you, in broad strokes, that these environments are one of humanity’s most important inventions and that innovation in this space is especially important right now. Here’s why.\n#1. Social Cohesion: Can we get along?\nProtests. Riots. Mobs raging in the street. The past two years have shown us more than ever how we struggle to get along at a societal level. And that’s even before we start talking about the difficulties of getting along with family at Thanksgiving dinner or the comments on the latest NextDoor post.\nLike many things, it is easy to take for granted, but getting along with one another is important, not only to reinforce a feeling of safety in where one lives, but to also provide a sense of belonging and social community.\nIf any neighborhood, town or city is going to have real staying power it will be because people want to live there. How to accomplish this is another matter. Amidst all the social strife that exists in our modern age, how do we go about creating communities that flourish?\n#2. Efficiency: Cheaper, Faster, Farther\nHow can we do more with less? In an age of increasing income inequality and tight budgets, you’d think we would spend more time thinking about ways to stretch the money we have. Whether in terms of housing, transit, professional opportunities, or more, the increased density a city possesses should offer immense efficiency for its residents in how they spend their money. After all, this is one of the key reasons humans began gathering together in primitive towns all those many years ago. Easier to be near the specialized skills – healers, farmers, house builders, etc. Easier to get to work or play by way of well-established roads. And so on. Cities are fundamentally an economic bargain and you should be better off living in a city in terms of time and money spent than you would be elsewhere. How can cities help us to do more with less?\n#3. Climate Change: Life or Death\nFloods in China and Germany, wildfires, drought and heatwaves throughout the American mountain west. While I can remember a time when doubt about the perils of climate change was boasted with pride – not too long ago unfortunately – the evidence that the climate is changing and we are the cause only continues to climb with a increasing financial and human cost(Coninck 2018). But where do cities come into play?\nSPM.1: Figure 1 of the Summary for Policymakers of the IPCC’s Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C.Of the five biggest sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at least three can be reduced by improving urban spaces. I’ll give a brief example for each.\nElectricity:\nA typical suburban home has, on average, 9 rooms to light, heat and cool each day. In contrast, an old school row home will typically have 4-5 rooms, and a proportionately smaller electric GHG footprint as a result.\n\nTransportation:\nLiving closer to other people should mean you don’t have to drive as far to work, or that there’s easier options through biking and/or public transit instead.\n\nManufacturing:\nIf you’re living in a smaller space, you don’t need or want as much stuff. Far more importantly, you also don’t need to build as many roads, pipes, or other infrastructure because you’re getting more use out of the infrastructure you already have in place.\n\nAs we look to the future and marshall what hope we have to meet the challenge a changing climate presents, how can we leverage our cities to be more resilient and help us stave off the worst possibilities climate change may present to humanity?\nThe Reality\nIt’s easy to see in the U.S.2, whether through suburban sprawl, traffic jammed highways, increasing cost of living or crime and safety issues, our cities fail to live up to the full promise that urban spaces ought to offer. Identifying the nature of these failings explicitly, as well as the solutions that may address them, will form much of the substance of this blog.\n\n\n\nConinck, Heleen C de. 2018. “IPCC Sr15: Summary for Policymakers.” In IPCC Special Report Global Warming of 1.5 c. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\n\nurban spaces is a term I will use interchangeably with cities to refer to any space in which humans live within close proximity to one another. It is not intended to be used with great precision here.↩︎\nThe U.S. will be the primary, though not exclusive focus of this blog.↩︎\n",
