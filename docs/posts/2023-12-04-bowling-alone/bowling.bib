               is a part of IPUMS Time Use, dedicated to making time use data
               easier for researchers to use. The American Time Use Survey
               (ATUS) ATUS is an ongoing annual time diary study, started in
               2003, that is funded by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
               (BLS) and fielded by the U.S. Census Bureau. It provides
               detailed information about the activities in which respondents
               engage together with extensive information about the
               characteristics of those respondents and other members of their
               households. The ATUS is a general purpose survey that already
               has been used to study a diverse range of topics, including
               parent time with children, gender differences in time devoted to
               household work, household production over the life cycle and its
               implications for the well-being of elderly Americans, hours of
               paid work, and the effects of shift work on time for other
               activities, to name just a few. IPUMS ATUS is an online data
               access system and available free of charge to registered users
               at www.ipums.org/timeuse.",
