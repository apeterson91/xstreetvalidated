	abstract = {Blighted and vacant urban land is a widespread and potentially risky environmental condition encountered by millions of people every day. About 15\% of the land in US cities is deemed vacant or abandoned, translating into an area roughly the size of Switzerland: over 3 million hectares of otherwise beneficial spaces remain neglected. Urban residents, especially in low-income neighborhoods, point to these spaces as primary threats to their health and safety. Cities continue to seek meaningful, evidence-based interventions for remediating vacant land. Standardized processes for the restoration of vacant urban land were experimentally tested on a citywide scale and found to significantly reduce gun violence, crime, and fear.Vacant and blighted urban land is a widespread and potentially risky environmental condition encountered by millions of people on a daily basis. About 15\% of the land in US cities is deemed vacant or abandoned, an area roughly the size of Switzerland. In a citywide cluster randomized controlled trial, we investigated the effects of standardized, reproducible interventions that restore vacant land on the commission of violence, crime, and the perceptions of fear and safety. Quantitative and ethnographic analyses were included in a mixed-methods approach to more fully test and explicate our findings. A total of 541 randomly sampled vacant lots were randomly assigned into treatment and control study arms; outcomes from police and 445 randomly sampled participants were analyzed over a 38-month study period. Participants living near treated vacant lots reported significantly reduced perceptions of crime (-36.8\%, P \&lt; 0.05), vandalism (-39.3\%, P \&lt; 0.05), and safety concerns when going outside their homes (-57.8\%, P \&lt; 0.05), as well as significantly increased use of outside spaces for relaxing and socializing (75.7\%, P \&lt; 0.01). Significant reductions in crime overall (-13.3\%, P \&lt; 0.01), gun violence (-29.1\%, P \&lt; 0.001), burglary (-21.9\%, P \&lt; 0.001), and nuisances (-30.3\%, P \&lt; 0.05) were also found after the treatment of vacant lots in neighborhoods below the poverty line. Blighted and vacant urban land affects people{\textquoteright}s perceptions of safety, and their actual, physical safety. Restoration of this land can be an effective and scalable infrastructure intervention for gun violence, crime, and fear in urban neighborhoods.},
