      "contents": "\n There’s nothing like a\ngood blog when you’re trying to dig into a subject and learn a bit more\nthan you did previously.\nIn contrast to their sexier siblings, the podcast and video essay,\nblogs allow for both a speedy read or an in-depth plunge with equal\nenjoyment. This latter feature is especially important when discussing\ntechnical topics, as I will be, since math is not something that is easy\nto understand when talked about but much more easily digested via\nreading. Good blogs are also a labor of love, written just as much for\nthe sake of satisfying the author’s own interest in a subject, as they\nare to provide material for a viewership.\nWith this blog, I’m hoping to check all the above boxes. The subject\nof interest, as the blog title may hint, lies at the intersection of\nstatistics and the built environment. This is a broad area, with which I\nhave some familiarity, but even\nin my dissertation work I have barely scratched the surface of what’s\nout there. So, although I may no longer be a formal academic, I still\nintend to delve deeper into those subjects in this space that I find\ninteresting, at my leisure. These may include ecological and socially\nrelevant ideas like tree cover\ndifferences across neighborhoods, statistically interesting ideas of\nhow to adjust an analysis for causal inference with interference, or more\neconomically grounded ideas that focus on debt service in suburban\ngrowth patterns. From statistics and urban planning to related\npolitics, economics and justice - I suspect the blog won’t lack for\nmaterial.\nWhile I hope to keep the blog’s writing as accessible as possible and\ndiscuss the material of interest in such a way that minimal prior\nknowledge is typically needed, I will also, not infrequently, dig into\ntechnical matters in some detail. I will do my best to provide summary\ncomments and label such posts so that some hint of what they offer may\nbe understood to those not technically trained.\nAbove all else, it is my hope that this blog will offer the\nopportunity to deepen an appreciation for this incredibly fascinating\nsubject at a time when it is woefully overlooked and yet more important\nthan ever.\nHappy Reading!\n-Adam\n\n\n\n",
