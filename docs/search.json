So, although I may no longer be a formal academic, I still intend to\ndelve deeper into those subjects in this space that I find interesting,\nat my leisure. These may include ecological and socially relevant ideas like\ntree cover differences\nacross neighborhoods, statistically interesting ideas of how to\nadjust an analysis for causal inference with interference,\nor more economically grounded ideas that focus on debt service in suburban growth patterns.\nFrom statistics and urban planning to related politics, economics and justice -\nI suspect the blog won’t lack for material.\nWhile I hope to keep the blog’s writing as accessible as possible and discuss\nthe material of interest in such a way that minimal prior knowledge is typically\nneeded, I will also, not infrequently, dig into technical matters in some detail.\nI will do my best to provide summary comments and label such posts so that\nsome hint of what they offer may be understood to those not technically trained.\nAbove all else, it is my hope that this blog will offer the opportunity to\ndeepen an appreciation for this incredibly fascinating subject at a time when\nit is woefully overlooked and yet more important than ever.\nHappy Reading!\n-Adam\n\n\n\n",
