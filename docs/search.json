So, although I may no longer be a formal academic, I still intend to\ndelve deeper into those subjects in this space that I find interesting,\nat my leisure. These may include ecological and socially relevant ideas like\ntree cover differences\nacross neighborhoods, statistically interesting ideas of how to\nadjust an analysis for causal inference with interference,\nor more economically grounded ideas that focus on debt service in suburban growth patterns.\nFrom statistics and urban planning to related politics, economics and justice -\nI suspect the blog won’t lack for material.\nWhile I hope to keep the blog’s writing as accessible as possible and discuss\nthe material of interest in such a way that minimal prior knowledge is typically\nneeded, I will also, not infrequently, dig into technical matters in some detail.\nI will do my best to provide summary comments and label such posts so that\nsome hint of what they offer may be understood to those not technically trained.\nAbove all else, it is my hope that this blog will offer the opportunity to\ndeepen an appreciation for this incredibly fascinating subject at a time when\nit is woefully overlooked and yet more important than ever.\nHappy Reading!\n-Adam\n\n\n\n",

While zoning is not the sexiest of topics,\nthe influence zoning has on our built environment cannot be overstated. Indeed,\nmany of the serious societal problems we’re facing in the US today, from\nhomelessness and housing prices to our dependence on cars, can find some major\nroot in the local zoning code.\nWhile I’ve been fascinated with and studied the built environment for years,\nthis was my first major foray into a text that explicitly touched the zoning\ncode. As such, I can’t comment on how effectively Elliot offers his readers an\naccurate picture of the zoning landscape, but I can say that my general\nimpression of Elliot’s expertise and his writing was very positive. I came away\nfeeling much more educated about the history of zoning in the US that led to our\ncurrent problems.\nI can’t hope to cover everything Elliot does in his book, but I’m hoping to\nprovide a brief overview of what zoning is and why it matters, a few key\nprinciples Elliot prescribes for better zoning, as well as touch on why I\nfind this topic so exciting. You can also take a look at my notes, for those\ninterested in reading more.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Zoning Map of Pittsburgh. Each color corresponds to a different zoning district. Data From wprdc.org\n\n\n\nZoning: What it is and What it isn’t\nThe logic behind zoning as a legal construct is the same as that quoted at the\nstart - place residences and/or businesses sufficiently apart from one another\nto prevent health and safety issues. Intuitively, this idea makes perfect sense.\nNobody wants to live near a factory billowing smoke, so carving out space on a\ncity map with one section for houses to be built, another for shops, and still\nanother for factories makes sense.\nThe first zoning law\nthat put these principles into practice in the US was\nwritten in New York and strongly influenced by the tenement acts, which\nestablished standards for room sizes, sanitation, and ventilation. A natural\nnext step from deciding people should have enough room within a building is\nto decide they should also have enough room between buildings.\nSimilarly, zoning also made distinctions between spaces for industrial\nbuildings, like factories, and residential or commercial buildings, like houses\nand shops. This kind of zoning is called “Euclidean Zoning,” named after a\ncourt case\nin Euclid, Ohio. Each zone that’s carved out for a specific use is\ncalled a zoning district. However, the notion of a zoning district quickly\nbecame abused. Categories started to proliferate faster than sensible rules\ncould restrain them:\n\n“[A] veterinarian wants to open up a clinic in a small-scale neighborhood\nbusiness zone but that is not a permitted use. The question has not come up\nbefore, and the city decides that it did not really intend to keep veterinarians\nout of neighborhood commercial areas. They are, after all, a neighborhood\nservice. The city proposes an amendment to add “veterinarian” as a permitted\nuse. The neighbors object and will support the zoning text change only if it is\nlimited to a 5,000 square-foot facility. “Done” says the city. Now the\nordinance has “veterinarian” and “veterinarian, under 5,000 sq. ft” in the\nlist of permitted uses. But the following year, when the scenario plays out\nagain across town, a different set of neighbors insists that there not be any\nanimals on the premises at night. That eliminates the risk of barking for the\nhouses across the alley. “Done,” says the city. Now we have “veterinarian, under\n5,000 sq. ft. no overnight boarding” in the list. Next, someone wants a\nbig facility and the neighbors are afraid of the noise and smell of the outdoor\ndog run, so “veterinarian, no outdoor enclosures” is added.” (p.44)\n\nObviously this all seems a bit silly, but as Elliot points out, this is not all\nthat hypothetical. City council members have a strong incentive to keep city\nresidents happy, so the urgent need to solve today’s problem often means\noverlooking the problems it will create tomorrow.\nIt is important to note that zoning codes describe a list of permitted uses\ntoday but are not in any way forward-looking. In contrast to this present-minded\nstate, there is also the concept of a “city plan” (or city planning), which\ntakes a forward-looking view to think about how specific areas of the city today\nmight be altered to fit a more unified vision of the city for tomorrow.\nYou’d think zoning and city plans might have a lot of overlap, but they tend to be thought of separately. Elliot attributes this to the two separate and disjointed publications by the Commerce Department, which introduced each of these ideas separately without providing any kind of unifying framework. The lack of cohesion can lead to problems. As one might imagine, it would be worth having the city plan built into the zoning code itself, so that changes to the zoning code were consistent with the long term vision of the city. However, because these two models of what the city should be were historically maintained separately, this did not always come to pass.\n\nThe two publications in question are the Standard Zoning Enabling Act of 1924\nand the Standard City Planning Enabling Act. You can learn more about these\nacts here\nPresent Day Consequences\nMuch of the book is spent exposing the flaws present in the typical kind of\nzoning codes practiced today in an effort to expose a key lesson on how zoning\ncould be improved moving forward. I’ll limit myself to just a few of these\nideas: Transportation Planning and Predictability vs. Flexibility.\nTransportation Planning\nI wanted to make sure to touch on transportation planning, given that it was\nthe subject of previous posts on the blog. Elliot notes that historically,\nzoning didn’t even consider transportation planning as part of their purview.\nA zoning district merely described what was or was not allowed in a certain\nspace of the city. While this might include certain details that implicitly\ntouched on transportation, like a minimum parking requirement, it typically had\nno concern for how many cars could come to or from the site in question.\nThis quickly became a concern, especially in the era of the automobile.\nA new apartment or mixed-use development could include hundreds of apartments\nand several new stores and restaurants leading to potentially hundreds of\nnew cars on nearby roads. Could the street network handle that increased\nvolume? Yes? No? Maybe?\nAs Elliot notes in the book, modeling traffic is not a straightforward exercise and, as I’ll invite you to imagine, involves any myriad number of assumptions about which mode of transit different residents or store customers will use, how often they’ll use it, etc.\nStill, as Elliot notes, it is worth considering transportation planning and zoning hand-in-hand. It likely does not make sense to zone a parcel of land near a one lane road for a mixed-use high density development like previously mentioned if it is understood that most residents will be car-dependent in the city. Zoning and transportation planning go hand-in-hand and current and future planners and city council members would do well to consider the interplay between the two.\nPredictability vs. Flexibility\nElliot repeatedly discusses the theme and balance of predictability vs.\nflexibility throughout his book. We’ve already hit on this idea with Elliot’s\nveterinarian example. Euclidean zoning implicitly strives to be predictable\nwithin each zoning district. Setting a zone district on the basis of uses\nsignals to both the developer and the consumer that there will be at least some\nlevel of uniform expectation within that zone - whether it be the type of\nbuilding built there, the setback off the street, or the maximum height of the\nbuilding. You can see this in the\nPittsburgh zoning code for example\n(Figure _).\n\n\n\nIn the above table, each base zoning district – Residential, Mixed Use, etc. – has different Residential uses that are “Permitted by Right”, denoted by a P in the table, meaning that there are no additional requests that need to be made to the zoning board in order to build. Alternatively, some may require an “Administrator exception” – meaning that a staff member of the city may have to use their judgment on whether or not the use is permitted, and so on. The general theme here being that one can typically expect to see the types of uses that are “permitted by right” in their respective zoning districts and so have some measure of what to expect when they invest or purchase a property there. Still, the system allows for flexibility in allowing individuals to apply for exceptions to the code in order to try to build for uses that would otherwise not be permitted.\nElliot hits on this theme in particular with a particular type of zoning device called the “Planned Developmental Unit” or PDU. A PDU is a “custom deal” whereby a developer works with a city to develop a zoning ordinance that works perfectly for the development that they’re planning. This represents the extreme side of flexibility and in principle, is intended to let a developer that’s looking to be creative build something that still adds to the city’s urban fabric, even if it doesn’t abide by all the zoning ordinances. Elliot notes here that this extra flexibility is great, but should be used sparingly, as it can easily overwhelm a, typically, low-staffed city planning department and prevent developers from getting permits to build.\nThere’s much more to say on other zoning and development tools that play a part in this balance between Predictability and Flexibility but I’ll finish this section by saying that as a statistician with an interest in the built environment, learning more about zoning has been a ton of fun to think about, especially as it relates to how one thinks about modeling different aspects of the urban experience\nA Statistician’s Perspective on Zoning\nAs a statistician who has studied the built environment, reading this book was\nfascinating in that it opened my eyes to the implicit model that we impose on\nour cities. As someone who works with models everyday, one of the first things\none always has to check is the implications of whatever model we’re proposing.\nBoth the successes and failures of zoning stem from our ability to anticipate\nand conceptualize the consequences of this implicit model.\nThinking even further, I can see the possibility of estimating, for a given\nzoning code, the kind of quality of life an individual might have depending on\nwhere they live in a city. We should be able to bring this back to our\ndevelopment of the zoning code itself, so in our aspirations to create\n“A Better Way to Zone”, we’re able to support the construction of a healthy,\nproductive and affordable built environment.\n\n\n\n",
