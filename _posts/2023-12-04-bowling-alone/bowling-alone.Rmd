## Introduction

One of the very first themes discussed in the 
[motivation](https://xstreetvalidated.com/posts/motivation/) for starting this 
blog was the notion of “social cohesion.” In a small post filled with imprecise
terms, social cohesion stood out as perhaps the most imprecise. In an attempt
to pin it down, I referred to ideas like crime, civil unrest, and a
feeling of belonging. In 
[Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community](http://bowlingalone.com/),
[Robert Putnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_D._Putnam) makes one of 
the best efforts I have seen, to speak more precisely and quantitatively about 
this nuanced and subtle topic [@putnam2000bowling]. He chooses a better term,
too: **social capital**.

Inspired by his previous research exploring the relationship between civic
engagement and healthy democracy, Putnam’s groundwork for writing Bowling Alone 
was a 1995 article that detailed Americans’ participation in various civic 
groups or activities during the 20th century[@putnam1995tuning]. Hypothesizing 
that a decline in these forms of participation would correspond to a 
proportionate increase in social–political problems, Putnam set out to document 
the state of US social capital in the decades between 1960 and 2000.

Putnam published the results of his work in the first edition of Bowling Alone 
in 2000. Two decades later, he published a revised and updated edition of 
Bowling Alone alongside a new book, 
[*The Upswing*](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Upswing/Robert-D-Putnam/9781982129156).
This new entry broadened the scope of the story, examining changes in social
capital from the late 1800s to 2020. The story he tells in the latter book is
one that might sound increasingly familiar. In a time of growing inequality, 
unhealthy civil dialogue and severe political polarization, it seems like the 
only thing Americans can agree on is that they disagree about everything. Putnam
points out this was as true at the turn of the 20th century as it has been in  
the 21st century. What happens in between is a story of America coming together 
in the face of two World Wars and then subsequently falling apart again amidst  
the rise of a new generation embroiled in social change. Putnam argues in both 
books that we should – must – come together again, as the challenges we face 
now are even greater than those faced in the 20th century.

I plan to focus my commentary predominantly on the material in Bowling Alone, 
but I will do my best to ground it in a modern context. In doing so, I hope to 
highlight both the relationship between the built environment and the various 
social measures that are our best proxy for tracking social capital and the 
importance of social capital itself. While social capital broadly refers to 
the notions of security and belonging that I mentioned previously, at its heart,
it's a measure of the strength of human relationships. As most individuals 
[report](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/11/18/what-makes-life-meaningful-views-from-17-advanced-economies/)
their relationships are the most important and fulfilling part of their 
lives and at a time when we are [lonelier than ever,](https://www.npr.org/2022/03/15/1086732931/politics-and-americas-loneliness-epidemic)
I think it's important to take note of how our environments can be more or less
supportive of our collective relationships' growth and stability.




## Outline

Putnam’s story of American social capital as told in Bowling Alone is separated 
into four parts. (1) Background on the concept of social capital and how Putnam 
confronts the difficult task of trying to measure it. (2) A description and 
summary of the various measures recorded over time that, to the best extent 
possible, represent social capital. (3) A causal description of why the changes 
in social capital occurred. And finally, (4) What now? Now that we know 
descriptively what’s happening and have some best effort theory for why the 
change is occurring, Putnam makes several high level calls to action for what 
we should do with this new understanding.

While Putnam works through seven different areas to describe the change in 
social capital in the US during the latter half of the 20th century, I’ll focus 
only on one – changes in informal social connections. Similarly, he provides 
five chapters working through possible explanations for why these changes 
occurred, but I will focus on two – mobility and technology. Finally, while 
Putnam writes eight chapters on the importance of social capital as relevant to
health, safety and economic prosperity to motivate action, I'll focus solely on 
Putnam’s arguments for what we should do now as well as provide my own 
perspective on this problem. 


## Social Capital: What is it and Why Should I care?

In his first chapter, Putnam gives a brief history on the term "social capital."
One early 20th century writer describes it as:

>“...those tangible substances [that] count for most in the daily lives of 
people: namely good will, fellowship, sympathy, and social intercourse among 
individuals and families who make up a social unit…If he comes into contact with
his neighbor, and they with other neighbors, there will be an accumulation of 
social capital, which may immediately satisfy his social needs and which may 
bear a social potentiality sufficient to the substantial improvement of living 
conditions of the whole community. The community as a whole will benefit by the 
cooperation of all its parts, while the individual will find in his associations
the advantages of the help, sympathy, and the fellowship of his neighbors.” 
– L.J. Hanifan, rural state supervisor of schools in West Virginia, writing in 
1916 in support of community involvement for rural schools.

Here we have the essence of what this story is about and why it is worth 
telling: social capital is synonymous with human relationships and they are: 
(1) the thing that counts for most in the daily lives of people and (2) may 
improve the living conditions of the whole community. 

While both of these things sound generally positive, it's worth considering the 
darker side of social capital, too. As Putnam notes, social capital can also 
refer to relationships formed through groups like the Ku Klux Klan just as much 
as social clubs like the Knights of Columbus or the Elks. Emphasizing this 
point, Putnam cites Jeff Coleman, a former leader of the KKK stating, “Really, 
we’re just like the Lions or the Elks. We want to be involved in the community” 
(p.22).

```{r}

```

Regardless of whether the social capital involved might be considered good or 
bad, if one were to set out to measure human relationships, they would 
immediately find themselves beset by all manner of challenges. Firstly, what 
human relationships should we focus on? How could we possibly measure whether a 
relationship exists or not and the relative strength of it therein? 


Putnam starts by making the following distinction in the kinds of social capital
that one might measure: (1) bridging – social capital that creates new 
relationships across previously defined groups, like a bowling league or board 
game group and (2) bonding – social capital that reaffirms or strengthens 
previously established bonds. Examples of bonding social capital include a 
church reading group or the aforementioned KKK. 

<aside>
While put forward as a simple dichotomy, I would invite you to imagine the ways
in which “bonding” social capital could still lead to “bridge” type experiences 
or vice versa. These terms are used as generalizations.
</aside>

To provide a best-effort measure of social capital, Putnam amasses an impressive
array of data sources, ranging from PTA memberships and social surveys to 
studies on all manner of social phenomena occurring in the decades leading up to
the 21st century. He weaves a narrative that can, at times, be overwhelming. 
Given the many dimensions involved – time, geography, gender, socioeconomic 
status, etc. – Putnam does his best to keep his story focused on a single idea: 
social capital is decreasing everywhere you look, no matter how it is measured. 
We will start our own exploration of this idea on a topic we can all relate to - 
social gatherings with friends. Along the way I'll do my best to reproduce or 
supplement Putnam's analysis using the data that he provides at his 
[website](http://bowlingalone.com/?page_id=7) as well as other social survey 
data from the past twenty years.

## Fewer Dinner Parties and Picnics: A Descriptive Account

To distill our discussion of the measures of social capital Putnam examines, 
I’ll limit my discussion of Part I of Bowling Alone to Chapter 6, 
“Informal Social Connections.” Following his discussion of more formal social 
roles – political participation, religious attendance, and membership in social 
groups like the Elks clubs – Putnam turns to what most of us think about when 
we think of human relationships – our friends, neighbors, and the people who 
we interact with regularly on a day-to-day basis. 

To estimate a pattern here, Putnam turns first to the 
[DDB Needham Lifestyle survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDB_Needham_Life_Style_Surveys),
which surveyed individuals across the US from 1975 to 1998. The first 
question Putnam looks at asks how often the respondent entertained friends at 
their house in the past year. A simple question with a straightforward answer. 
According to Putnam’s analysis, “In the mid-to-late 1970s…the average American 
entertained friends at home about fourteen-to-fifteen times per year. By the 
late 1990s, that figure had fallen to eight times per year, a decline of 45 
percent in barely two decades.” (p.98)  Looking at other data sources (
[Roper Archives](https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/featured-collections/roper-social-and-political-trends), 
[Yankelovich Partners](https://yankelovichcenter.ucsd.edu/public-engagement/surveys-and-reports.html))
collected independently of the DDB data that asked similar questions, Putnam 
found similar decreases. 

When I looked at the DDB data available on the book’s website, it wasn’t clear 
to me how Putnam conducted his analysis, but I try to reproduce something 
similar to what he did by computing the proportion of individuals who gave or 
attended *any* number of dinner parties or entertained at all in the past year. 
I also include similar estimates for individuals responding to having gone on 
any picnics, or agreeing to any extent that their family regularly has dinner 
together. The plot in Figure \@ref(fig:Informal-Social-Connections) shows a 
precipitous decrease over the two decades of interest across these measures.

```


To be sure, there’s plenty more that could be said here. These measures, while 
consistently downward, do vary across men and women, urban vs. rural, and so on.
In Bowling Alone, Putnam argues that the overarching trend is that, as the turn 
of the century approached, Americans spent less time with their friends than 
they had previously. It is in considering how this time would be spent otherwise
that we turn to Putnam’s arguments for why these changes occurred the way they 
did.

<aside>
In his foreword to the revised edition, Putnam is less convinced that he has 
made a foolproof case that social connections have decreased. See his arguments
there for more discussion on the research in this area.

## The Time It Takes to Build Social Capital: A Causal Account 

In looking to understand **why** social capital declined in the US, Putnam 
considers several probable causes ranging from changes in technology – the 
spread of television and automobile use – to changes in social norms and the 
shift-change of generations. The unifying theme for the most compelling of these
causes that take effect across all generations is that the time Americans used 
to dedicate to one another in their community is decreasing, while the time 
spent on other activities (e.g. driving, TV, or work) now competes more 
successfully for Americans’ attention.

We’ll start with driving. Construction on the interstate highway began in the 
1950s and continued in the three decades that followed, allowing the US 
population to migrate to suburban areas from cities or nonmetro, smaller towns 
(See Figure \@ref(fig:suburbanization) from the book). This change is important
to dwell on. 

Putnam points out that small town America was often the site of the greatest 
social capital in the country – the small towns where you knew your mailman and 
the local bartender. If suburbs were less amenable to the development of social 
capital than small towns, the rise of suburbia could play a large role in the 
observed decreases in social capital.

```{r}

#| fig.cap = "Figure 52 From Bowling Alone by Robert Putnam 
#|   [@putnam2000bowling]."
knitr::include_graphics("suburbanization.png")
```


This is precisely the argument that Putnam makes. Suburbs are not only 
[infamous](https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america)
for explicitly excluding certain “undesirables” on the basis of race and class, 
they also contributed to a deterioration of social connection within, due to 
increased driving times. As Putnam cites one Californian’s experience,

> “I live in Garden Grove, work in Irvine, shop in Santa Ana, go to the dentist 
in Anaheim, my husband works in Long Beach and I used to be the president of 
the League of Women Voters in Fullerton“. (p.211)

It’s difficult to provide definitive evidence that more time driving *caused* 
individuals to be less social. Since we can’t randomly assign different 
commutes to individuals, the best we can do without a 
[natural experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_experiment) or a 
longitudinal cohort, is to look at association measures and just how much time 
is spent driving. 

Putnam does just that, reporting that the typical American spent 72 minutes 
every day behind the wheel in 2000 – more time than was spent (on average) 
cooking and eating or that parents spent with their children. Furthermore, 
Putnam identifies an individual’s commute time as the second most influential 
demographic variable (after education) associated with that 
individual’s expected civic involvement and informal social commitments. 

<aside>
One might be quick to point out that Putnam's estimate from 20 years ago doesn’t 
hold much relevance today. However, 
[AAA](https://www.aaa.com/),
[reported](https://aaafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AAAFTS_Research-Brief_2022-American-Driving-Survey2020-2021.pdf)
that US drivers spent 61 minutes on average in the car in 
2021. An 11-minute difference from Putnam’s 2000 estimate. 
</aside>

This is a big deal. If time is our most valuable asset, and we are spending a 
significant amount of it on something as simple as getting from A to B, 
rather than on the things that matter most in life, it’s fair to say we have 
gone very wrong somewhere.

Of course, the advent of the suburbs isn’t solely responsible for all of the 
observed decreases in social capital. One subject that Putnam points to as an 
even bigger factor in the decline of social capital is the rise of mass media 
technology, specifically television use.


### Let's not Forget about TV

When looking at the impact of television on social capital in the latter half of
20th century America, Putnam paints a stark picture. Given the chance to escape 
from the daily company of their neighbors, millions of US citizens flock to 
their TV screens to, as Putnam quotes T.S. Eliot, “Listen to the same joke at 
the same time, and yet remain lonesome” (p.217).

The uptake of the TV into American homes transpires with impressive speed. 
Putnam cites evidence showing that while it took 48 years for the air 
conditioner to become widespread – present in 75% of American households – it 
took the television only seven years to reach the same 
benchmark[@bowden1994household]. And what do we do with all these TVs? We watch
them! Putnam’s most conservative estimate for how much time was spent watching 
TV in the late 90’s is roughly three hours a day, 40% of the average American’s 
free time in 1995. My own analysis -- see Figure \@ref(fig:tvwatchplot) --  of 
[American Time Use Survey](https://www.bls.gov/tus/) data shows that number was 
largely the same in 2022[@Flood2023-os]. If you’re wondering what Americans 
would do with some, if not all, of that time if they weren’t regularly watching 
TV, Putnam’s best guess is that they would be socializing.

Putnam identifies all manner of antisocial behavior associated with habitual 
television viewing. He starts with some of his usual measures of civic 
engagement: "39 percent of light TV viewers attended some public meeting on 
town or school affairs last year as compared with only 25% of the 
demographically-matched heavy TV viewers amongst working-age, college-educated 
individuals. Similarly, light viewers were nearly three times more likely to 
have made a speech last year than an equally well educated heavy viewer" (p.228).
Going further, Putnam reports that those who identify TV as their “primary form 
of entertainment” show a consistently lower level of social involvement 
compared to those that don’t report TV as their primary form of engagement. 
This is seen consistently across several dimensions and across time -- See 
Figure \@ref(fig:tvplot).

Perhaps the most conclusive evidence to demonstrate the idea that an uptake in 
TV use will lead to a decline in social involvement comes from a study of remote
communities in northern Canada before and after the introduction of television 
in the 1970s – a natural experiment[@williams1979impact]. The town of “Notel” –
a pseudonym to protect the inhabitants of the town – did not have access to 
television in 1973. This was not intentional – due to a quirk of its location 
in a valley, the transmitter meant to serve the area did not provide reception 
for most residents. Nearby neighbor towns “Unitel” and “Multitel” were similar 
in ethnic and economic mix but *did* have access to television. As the 
researchers go on to report: 

> “Before Notel had television, residents in the longitudinal sample attended a 
greater variety of club and other meetings than did residents of both Unitel 
and Multitel, who did not differ. There was a significant decline in Notel 
following the introduction of television, but no change in either Unitel or 
Multitel.” – [The Impact of Television](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED172293)

Putnam follows the researchers of this study in arguing that this evidence 
points the finger in a way that previous data cannot, that the act of habitual 
TV viewing leads to a decrease in outgoing, prosocial behavior. 

Putnam’s conclusion from these data about TV’s impact on the larger picture of 
social capital is simple: There isn’t enough time in the day for both regular 
TV viewing and regular social and community involvement. Putnam makes his most 
damning condemnation on this topic: 

> A major commitment to television viewing – such as most of us have come to 
have – is incompatible with a major commitment to community life (p.229).


### From One Screen To Another

It's hard not to think about the Internet and 
[smartphone use](https://www.reviews.org/mobile/cell-phone-addiction/) when 
reading about Putnam's work on TV. Putnam’s writing about the antisocial 
behavior associated with habitual and prolonged TV use echos his writing about 
the Internet in the Afterword of the 2020 edition of Bowling Alone:

> “Lonely people express a preference for using the Internet for social 
interaction and are more likely to use the Internet in a way that displaces 
time spent in offline social activities…” (p.432) 

History repeats itself. If America is to rebuild its stores of social capital, 
it will have to find new ways to bring Americans together face-to-face in a way 
that can effectively compete with the allure of digital technology 
[@hampton2011core;@nowland2018loneliness;@Carty_2019].


## What Now? Both Then and Now

Putnam ends his book with a chapter entitled “Toward an Agenda for Social 
Capitalists”, in which he lays out his high-level aspirations for readers of his 
book to vote, work, and donate toward by the year 2010. This includes broad 
statements such as:

> “Let us act to ensure that by 2010 Americans will spend less time traveling 
and more time connecting with our neighbors than we do today, that we will live 
in more integrated and pedestrian friendly areas, and that the design of our 
communities and the availability of public space will encourage more casual 
socializing with friends and neighbors” (p.408).

And: 

> “Let us find ways to ensure that by 2010 Americans will spend less leisure time 
sitting passively alone in front of glowing screens and more time in active 
connection with our fellow citizens. Let us foster new forms of electronic 
entertainment and communication that reinforce community engagement rather than 
forestalling it” (p.410).

Of course, in 2024, we can see that progress towards these goals has been 
middling at best. As Putnam describes in his book, it took the impact of two 
world wars to bring together America in a way that was reflected in these social
measures and it’s difficult to imagine something less dramatic that could bring 
America together again.

That's not to say all is lost. There is still a lot to be learned from Putnam’s 
writing. While the path to the world he envisions requires the kind of reforms 
I've written about elsewhere involving, for example, 
[zoning reform,](https://xstreetvalidated.com/posts/2023-07-15-betterwaytozonereview/)
my strongest impression from reading over this 
material was how our use of technology can cause more problems than it 
solves. While I’m generally a fan of technology – cars, television, 
smartphones, etc. – there is little doubt after reading through this book that 
we can overuse our tech and in so doing, lose sight of what is really important. 

When we replace time having picnics and dinner parties with our friends with
more time spent driving on our commute or watching TV, it's clear to me we have 
lost sight of what is important. Putnam frames this as an issue of social and 
political concern and he is right – by spending less time with one another we are 
less likely to be open to new ideas and get outside our preferred ideological 
“bubble” [@cinelli2021echo].  

Even more so than this being a political issue though, I consider it a moral 
one. This isn’t a philosophy blog, and I am not looking to develop a new 
metaphysics, but if we were to ask ourselves what it means to live a good life 
or what makes life worth living, most of us would think of 
the time we can spend creatively with one another and less of time spent 
watching the latest TV show or internet phenomenon[@Silver_2021]. Arranging our
built environment to better incorporate this value will take a considerable and 
concerted effort.

This leads me to a second, related lesson from this book: The realization that 
cities have to think of themselves as competing for the time and attention of 
Americans. Reworking the built environment won't solve all the problems 
presented in Bowling Alone and it may be true that there will never be anything 
as satisfying as the cheap and quick dopamine hit that one can get from turning 
on the TV or unlocking their smartphone,  but my aspiration is that cities 
reach the absolute limit of their ability in supporting individuals' chance 
to forge worthwhile connections. My hope is that cities can develop such 
enthralling beauty, such readily observed potential for social opportunity -- 
not to mention affordability -- that car commutes and electronic entertainment 
take their rightful place as a much more modest portion of Americans’ time.

## Other Resources on Bowling Alone {.appendix}

One of the advantages of Bowling Alone’s popularity and 2000 publication date is
that there are a plethora of resources to explore that offer further 
perspectives on his work. See below for a sample of these:

1. [NPR episode](https://www.npr.org/2022/03/15/1086732931/politics-and-americas-loneliness-epidemic)
2. [Volunteering is on the decline](https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=1218999240:1218999241)
3. [Formal Analysis of Bowling Alone](https://www.amazon.com/Bowling-Alone-Library-Elizabeth-Morrow/dp/1912127725/ref=sr_1_4?crid=31SI8BENCX63G&keywords=bowling+alone&qid=1705789676&sprefix=bowlign+alone%2Caps%2C71&sr=8-4)

In my research into car commuting times I also found [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/10/magazine/dangerous-driving.html) 
that describes a peak in car commute times, as well as a
disturbing increase in automobile caused traffic fatalities across the US.
