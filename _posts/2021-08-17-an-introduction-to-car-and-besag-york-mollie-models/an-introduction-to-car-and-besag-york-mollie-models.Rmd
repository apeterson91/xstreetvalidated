on a spatial model that will allow us to model correlation across a network
of city streets: The Conditional Auto Regressive or CAR Model.

## CAR models

* See chapter blah in  "Hierarchical Modeling and Analysis for Spatial Data" by
Banerjee, Carlin and Gelfand. 
* There is a nice write up on this topic with particular attention paid to
implementation details in stan and an application for disease and demography 
modeling [here](https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/icar_stan.html).
