Bike lanes, climbing lanes and sharrows, oh my! The rise of commuting 
by bike has risen dramatically over the past two decades as everything from
climate change and traffic jams to gas prices and health issues have sent cities
looking for easy ways to provide cheap, healthy, efficient and environmentally 
friendly modes of transit to their residents(See Figure \@ref(fig:commute)). 
In fact, some cities are even trying to go "car free"[@nieuwenhuijsen2016car].
But why bikes? They may have been fun to ride around with 
your friends when you were growing up, but do they really offer a viable 
alternative to the crown jewel of american transit - the automobile? 
This post will look at how a bike compares to a car as a primary mode of 
transit highlight the critical role that 
[land use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_use), 
[zoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoning), and other forms of transit play 
in the process.

# Cost Time and Safety

Every day people need to go places. They need to go to work,
^[ Okay, not as much as they used to maybe.] to the grocery store, to the 
doctor, and so on. Importantly, before any given person makes their choice of 
how to go from A to B, the environment they live in will play a large role in 
determining their choice as well. As the environment determines how far an 
individual will have to go to reach their destination, what routes and modes 
of transit are available, the likelihood of traffic, and so on, some 
environments will be more amenable to certain types of transit than others. 

If your entire neighborhood has been 
[zoned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoning#Single-use_zoning) only for 
single family residential homes, and the nearest grocery store is a 10 minute 
car ride, 30 minute bike or 20 minute bus ride with wait, and the route to the grocery store does not feel
safe to walk or bike on, then the obvious choice of purchasing and using a car 
will be made. We don't have to build our environments like this however, 
Figure \@ref(fig:extrips) show how two such trips in the city of Philadelphia
that I once made regularly by biking, walking or transit exclusively.


```{r extrips, fig.cap = "Examples of two trips for grocery and work respectively for a resident of the Spring Garden Neighborhood in Philadelphia."}
philly_hoods <- read_sf("~/Documents/CityData/Philly/geo-data/Neighborhoods_Philadelphia/Neighborhoods_Philadelphia.shp") %>% 
  filter(MAPNAME %in% c("Spring Garden","University City"))
#phsdf <- read_sf("~/Documents/CityData/Philly/CompleteStreets-shp/") %>% 
#  st_transform(st_crs(philly_hoods)) %>% 
#  st_filter(philly_hoods)
spring_univ <- philly_hoods %>% st_transform(4326) %>% st_centroid()
groceries_philly <- stplanr::route(
  from = as.vector(spring_univ$geometry[[1]]),
  to = c(-75.174294, 39.962923), 
  route_fun = osrmRoute,
  returnclass = "sf"
  )
work_philly <- stplanr::route(
  from = as.vector(spring_univ$geometry[[1]]),
  to = as.vector(spring_univ$geometry[[2]]),
  route_fun = osrmRoute,
  returnclass = "sf"
)
groceries <- groceries_philly %>% 
  select(duration,distance) %>% 
  rename(`Trip Distance (km)` = distance,
         `Car Trip Time (min, assumes no traffic)` = duration)
work <- work_philly %>% 
  select(duration,distance) %>% 
  rename(`Trip Distance (km)` = distance,
         `Car Trip Time (min, assumes no traffic)` = duration)
mp <- mapview::mapview(groceries,color='green') + 
  mapview::mapview(work,color='blue')

mp@map
```

In both circumstances, the choices are made based upon what is most convenient
according to the perception of how the mode of transit on the route varies 
as a function of (1) trip time, (2) trip cost and (3) trip safety 
[@transitwikibook].

```{r,eval = FALSE}
pa_pums <- get_pums(
  variables = c("PUMA", "JWMNP", "JWTR", "COW", "ESR","JWTRNS"),
  state = "PA",
  survey = "acs5",
  year = 2018,
  rep_weights = "both"
  )
```

##  Cost

What follows may seem like common sense. However, sometimes 
even common sense bears repeating. If we were to consider the 4 modes of transit
that are most popular (1) walking, (2) biking, (3) driving in a personal car
and (4) taking public transit^[Airplane travel might fairly 
be considered public transit, but we're concerned with modes of transit 
used daily for regular trips.] (e.g. bus, subway, etc.). We could broadly 
consider the cost of each to be something like what we see
in the table below.


```{r}
tibble(Mode = c("Walking","Biking","Public Transit","Driving"),
       Cost = c("Free", "Cheap", "Affordable", "Expensive")) %>% 
  gt()
```

Walking is free of course, a typical commuting bike 
(not those fancy carbon fiber bikes) costs a few hundred dollars, 
public transit fares are explicitly designed to be affordable, and 
driving ... well driving costs a bit. 

The upfront cost is usually in the 
thousands of (U.S.) dollars for a used car, and typically in the 
tens of thousands for a new car. Furthermore, most states in the U.S. will 
require individuals to regularly register their car, as well as have it 
inspected and insured. On top of *that*, most car manufacturers recommend 
car owners maintenance their vehicle twice a year or every 20,000 miles --- 
whichever comes first. The cost of gas, which one might buy more or less of 
depending on the kind of car they have and how 
many miles they drive, tends to vary substantially depending on what 
state/country one lives in and what global economic forces are in play at the 
time. We haven't even gotten to depreciation yet and there are still
*even more* costs. Cars' use of gas contributes to global warming and
also plays a role in air pollution [@johansson2017impacts].

about cost depreciation associated with car purchases in this pbs

</aside>

With all the money a car requires, totaling somewhere in the thousands of dollars
both initially and, potentially, regularly depending on one's driving patterns, 
it seems an obvious question to ask why it is the dominant mode of transit in 
much of the modern world, and especially in the U.S.? Well to really do justice
to that question and answer it in all its worth would take more time than this 
post can afford. We'll explore some of the advantages a car has even with 
all its expense in the sections that follow, but with this starting cost,
it shouldn't be hard to see why so many cities are starting to turn to bikes.



## Time 

Given all the cost we're spending to be in our cars, surely the car owner 
can rest easy knowing that they're opting for a mode of transit that is 
far quicker and safer, right? Well ... it depends. 

While it is undeniably true that the longer the distance, the more favorable 
the car becomes as a mode of transit (see Figure \@ref(fig:ptc) from 
[@lovelace2017propensity]), this isn't usually the type of trip most 
often made day-to-day in urban (or even some suburban) environments. 

For short trips such as these, car trips will take much longer, because their 
drivers will have to wait in traffic and, again, depending on the environment, 
look/pay for parking. In contrast, a bike rider will typically not have to 
wait for any traffic^[This may depend on the presence of bike lanes,
the bike riders comfort with passing cars, etc.] and almost never have to pay 
or wait for parking.

```{r ptc,fig.align='center',fig.width=14,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Figure from [@lovelace2017propensity] -see original caption in figure."}
knitr::include_graphics("ptc.png")
```

One  key factor may be confounding our argument here. Cars have to 
wait in traffic because there are so many cars, whereas bikes don't because 
there aren't a proportional number of cyclists, right? Well, 
even if there *were* more cyclists, it's not likely they'd have to wait too 
long in traffic. This is simply because of the efficiency in space that a bike 
has compared to a vehicle. Where a bike takes up $\approx$ 5 feet lengthwise, and 
a "human-size" width (maybe a foot or two), a typical sedan will be about 14 
feet long and 5 feet wide^[taken from nadaguides.com].  If we compare area
footprints, that implies that a car takes up 7 times more space than a cyclist. 
This huge efficiency will mean a lot more cyclists can be put on the road than
cars and still achieve a level of decent transit throughput.

<aside>
This space efficiency carries through to parking as well which is the 
source of many woes in urban development. We'll follow up on this later 
through the work of the economist Donald Shoup.

## Safety

While this is the last topic, this is by far the most important!! No one
would get in car if they thought there were good odds of the trip ending 
in disaster.
And yet, automobile accident fatalities continue to number in the tens of 
thousands each year, with countless more causing injury and property damage
[@nhtsa]. 
Why is this? The simple (physics) fact is that cars have a lot of mass and 
when they hit something while moving at a decent speed, an 
appreciable amount of de-acceleration occurs. Consulting our good old friend, 
Sir Isaac Newton's second law, we can recall that:

$$
\text{Force} = \text{Mass} \times \text{Acceleration}
$$
Large mass and large acceleration = large force = injuries, death, and property
damage. 

In contrast... a bike with a human on board has much less mass and since bikes 
rarely go *too* fast, even in the age of e-bikes, there's not as severe a 
de-acceleration when hitting a stationary object. Consequently, a bike 
collision, *sans* car, does not produce as much force as their automobile 
counterparts. This isn't to say that there can't be meaningful harm as a 
result of bike accidents, or that, in an environment where bikes are a 
predominant form of transit, accidents won't happen. However, the physics are 
certainly more supportive of bike transit producing safer trips --- 
fundamentally --- in comparison to cars.


## Groceries, weather, kids and more

Yes, well bikes may have these advantages but what about when you have to haul 
a week's worth of groceries home, take your kids to school, or get to work 
in bad weather? Just as adaptation measures were and are taken to try and
improve the feasibility of cars' weakness --- seat belts, anti-drunk driving
campaigns, and so on --- there are equivalent adaptation measures that are 
taken by those committed to commuting by bike. 
[Cargo bikes](https://tinyurl.com/2p9496h2), especially their electric variants,
are one preferred strategy for hauling goods and/or children to and fro, 
though there are also some services offering grocery delivery by bike as well.
Bad weather may be simply overcome by a mixture of proper clothing and 
equipment.

However, bikes are still not and cannot be for everyone. Those who are unable 
to ride bikes, due to a lack of physical capacity for instance, still need a 
service that can offer them a means of transportation across a city and it 
is for *this* population, that cars --- or possibly buses --- should 
undoubtedly be offered.


# Bikes, Buses and Beyond! 

While this post likely covers a lot of material that may feel like common 
knowledge, I'm hoping to use it as the foundation from which to carry this topic
further. What kind of efforts are being taken in the U.S. and across the globe 
as better support bike, pedestrian and public transit infrastructure? What 
statistical innovations can we develop to further these causes? More on these
ideas soon!
